# MyLift - Plan Your Workouts
> Workout Planner & Timer made as a first year university programming project

## Usage
### Adding workout
- Click "Add Workout" to create routines with exercises, sets, reps, and rest time
between each set.
    - ***Rep**: The repetition of a single exercise*
    - ***Set**: A set of reps*
        - 3 sets of 8 reps = 24 repetitions of an exercise with rest time in between sets

### Start working out:
- Click "<u>**Start Workout** </u>" to view a list of your workouts. Click the `i` button for
more information about your workout, or click the play button to get started!

### Efficiency
- You can focus on resting while the app handles the rest time. A sound plays
to let you know your rest is done!
