Plan Your Workouts:
- Click "Add Workout" to create routines with exercises, sets, reps, and rest time
between each set.

    - Rep: The repetition of a single exercise
    - Set: A set of reps (3 sets of 8 reps = 24 repetitions of an exercise with rest
    time in between sets)

Start working out:
- Click "Start Workout" to view a list of your workouts. Click the 'i' button for
more information about your workout, or click the play button to get started!

Efficiency:
- You can focus on resting while the app handles the rest time. A sound plays
to let you know your rest is done!
